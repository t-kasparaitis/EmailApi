@*The error below seems to happen with Chrome & Visual Studio (latest edition). It happens on tab merges in specific.
    The number of tabs being merged is not relevant, it can happen with 1 such as opening an external link, or with many more.
    At first I thought I had introduced a bug, but this was replicated on a 2nd web app project where I slowly merged changes.
    Then I tested on Microsoft's default starter web app project and a tab merge killed the client host yet again. I tested
    the main project with no other tabs, the client ran without issues for 30+ minutes. The same project was crashing in <30 sec
    everytime before. The exit error is below:

    "has exited with code 4294967295 (0xffffffff)"

    The link below shows that it was a bug with an older version of VS, but it still happens. In the future maybe testing with
    VS Code or something else may be a better idea.
